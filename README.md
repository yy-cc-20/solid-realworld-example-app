- CRUD Articles

* I hard coded the api response, so when you are doing add, edit, delete, follow/unfollow etc, the value won't update, because it will refetch from the hard coded api response.

## Usage

Those templates dependencies are maintained via [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) via `pnpm up -Lri`.

This is the reason you see a `pnpm-lock.yaml`. That being said, any package manager will work. This file can be safely be removed once you clone a
template.

```bash
$ npm install # or pnpm install or yarn install
```
